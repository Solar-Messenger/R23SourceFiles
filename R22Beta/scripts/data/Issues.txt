Issues
1. Currently theres a resource contention issue when multiple players access the selectedUnits table.
	- Proposed solution: split selectedUnits into 8 individual tables.

2. If a unit dies that was assigned as the anchor of another which is currently bugging, it should acquire a new anchor and subsequently be re-assigned the move command.
